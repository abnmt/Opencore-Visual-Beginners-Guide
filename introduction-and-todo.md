# Introduction & TODO

### Quickstart Overview

On a computer with macOS and Xcode do the following

1. Download OCBuilder
2. Download OpenCore via OCBuilder \(check OC version\)
3. [Download Open Core Configurator](https://mackie100projects.altervista.org/download-opencore-configurator/) \(check OCC version compatibility\)
4. Copy sample.plist to EFI folder and rename
5. Edit config.plist in Open Core Configurator \(following the guide\)
6. Download TINU
7. Download macOS using TINU \(via App Store\)
8. Create USB using TINU \(which adds macOS and OC EFI folder\)

### Why this guide

I want to create a beginner friendly OpenCore guide which uses advanced GUI Tools to create a vanilla hackintosh install. Everything done by these GUI tools is transparent to the user and allows complete customisation. All downloads are from official sources, usually from the Github repos of the original developers.

### Who this guide is for

* those who are fairly new to hackintoshing \(preferably have at least some prior hackintosh experience\)
* those who are new to OpenCore, who would like a quickstart to get into OpenCore
* those who would like to try a new beginner friendly workflow which might help to get friends or family to learn how to hackintosh

### Hardware Prerequisites

* an existing computer running macOS \(High Sierra, Mojave or Catalina\)
* recent beginner friendly hardware
  * Intel CPU \(Kaby Lake or Coffee Lake\)
  * preferably Gigabyte or ASUS Mobo
  * 8 GB or more RAM 
  * NVMe or Sata SSD as main drive
  * AMD GPU or use iGPU
  * compatible Wifi & Bluetooth

### Software to download and Tools to be used

* TINU 3.0 Beta 2 or above
  * macOS Mojave 10.14.6+ or Catalina 10.15.2+
* Hackintool 2.8.8 or above
* OpenCore 0.5.3 or above
* Open Core Configurator 1.10.2 or above
* OCBuilder
* optional [OC-Tool](https://github.com/rusty-bits/OC-tool) for maintenance
